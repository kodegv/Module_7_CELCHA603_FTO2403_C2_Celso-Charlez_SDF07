# [SDF07] Project: CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile

Welcome to my submission for the SDF07 CodeSpace Pets Instagram profile project! In this project, I had the opportunity to explore and practice various CSS techniques, including CSS grids, flex displays, and flexbox. It was an enjoyable journey transforming HTML into a stylish Instagram profile.

## Challenges:

Throughout the project, I encountered several challenges that helped me grow as a developer:

1. **Spacing Between Flex Display Elements:** Achieving consistent spacing between flex display elements proved to be challenging. It required experimenting with different CSS properties to ensure proper alignment and spacing.

2. **Organizing CSS File:** As the CSS file grew larger, organizing the styles became increasingly challenging. I had to develop a systematic approach to structuring my CSS rules to maintain readability and ease of maintenance.

3. **HTML Classes with Spaces:** Initially, I faced difficulties with HTML classes that contained spaces. To overcome this issue, I opted to use IDs instead, which provided a cleaner solution while maintaining specificity.

## What I Learned:

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights and skills, including:

1. **Hover Actions:** Implementing hover actions was an exciting learning experience yet again. Even though I had epxerience from previous lessons, making sure I remember how to utilise the hover actions was my main goal for some elements, like the buttons and gallery items.

2. **Flex Display for Columns:** Utilising flex display for creating columns provided a flexible and responsive layout. I learned how to efficiently structure content in a grid format while ensuring compatibility across various screen sizes.

Overall, this project was a fantastic opportunity to apply and expand my knowledge of CSS techniques. I look forward to implementing these skills in future projects and continuing to refine my development skills.
